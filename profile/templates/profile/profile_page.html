                            <b>Hi there!</b> <br/><br/>I’m Simon, and I like to help people solve complex problems. Whether these problems centre around how to best learn complex grammar rules, how to structure a database or how to find the perfect candidate for a role, I have found success in my career in effectively breaking down and resolving complex issues in collaboration with the people around me. <br/><br/>

                            My career so far has been quite varied, to say the least! I graduated from Durham University in 2009, having studied Economics with French. In the wake of a Global Recession, my plans of going into Management Consultancy were dashed, and so I decided instead to pursue a career in teaching – a career which appealed to my people and language skills. I completed my teacher training (PGCE) at Warwick University and enjoyed a very successful 5-year teaching career in the UK before moving to Dubai for another 4. My time in teaching taught me so much, but more than anything allowed me to sharpen my communication skills in a huge range of situations, particularly collaboration, critical listening and tact.<br/><br/>

                            In 2019 I took the decision to leave the teaching profession and return the UK in a new role outside of education. There were several reasons for this, one of which was my fast-growing obsession with technology and data; an area in which I had worked extensively - particularly in Dubai. By this point, I was developing whole departmental data systems in Access, Excel and VBA which would handle thousands of datapoints, and it was having a hugely positive impact on the workflow of my friends and colleagues. It was this interest in the world of data and development that led me to apply for recruitment roles within the data industry. I chose this for a couple of reasons; firstly as I was keen to learn more about the world of data – the technologies involved, the different industry roles, and where my own skills might one day fit in. Meanwhile recruitment, as an industry where communication skills, relationship-building and resilience are paramount, seemed like a natural fit for my strong soft skills. This turned out to be a very successful move, and even in the first few months I was able to set myself apart from other technical recruiters with my deep understanding of data technologies. However, I soon found myself once again invested in my own company’s data challenges, this time using more advanced technologies such as SQL Server, Python, SSIS and Power BI. By late 2020 I was developing Python scripts to pull data from REST APIs, making ETL packages to handle huge datasets, and reporting to senior managers on matters of data quality and strategy.<br/><br/>

                            At this point, I’ve been solving data problems for over a decade alongside my primary roles. Perhaps more tellingly, these are not challenges which were put upon me – I have actively sought them out through my own genuine interest and passion for data, and through my own belief that a strong data infrastructure is at the heart of effective business operations. I have taught myself the skills needed in my own time, and have added huge additional value in all of my positions so far as a result. Now, I’m excited to be taking the final (possibly inevitable) step into a fully data-centric role, where I can entirely focus on helping businesses to improve the availability, quality and visibility of their data.<br/><br/>

                                More than any other skill, I pride myself on my strong verbal and written communication skills.

                            I love to learn! It’s one of the things that attracts me to technology so much, and the main reason I originally entered education.
